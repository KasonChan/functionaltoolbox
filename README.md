Functional toolbox
==================

The repository is dedicated for recording what I learnt in functional 
programming in Scala with Simple Build Tool (SBT) and Akka. And it will be used 
as a toolbox (notes) for me when I need some references including code snippets,
basic set up projects, templates, etc.
